# Boulder-Dash

Designed and built a retro-style video game in MIPS assembly language, combining elements from Boulder Dash and Minecraft with unique, original mechanics.
Engineered the game logic from scratch, including player movement, collision detection, and dynamic object interactions in a constrained low-level environment.
Optimized performance and memory usage, demonstrating an in-depth understanding of low-level programming, assembly instructions, and efficient game mechanics.
Debugged and fine-tuned game elements using MIPS simulation tools, ensuring smooth gameplay and a polished user experience.
